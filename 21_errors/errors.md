#### JavaScript typically uses `throw`/`try/catch` for error handling. This lesson demonstrates the Go idiom of returning errors as values by returning `{ val, err }` objects and using destructuring. Custom error types extend the built-in `Error` class. Type checking uses `instanceof` in place of Go's type assertion `e.(*argError)`.
