# Basics of Coding Bun
## Preface
What this text is and what it is not: This text is intended to introduce the reader to the basics of the JavaScript programming language (running on Bun) in the sense that they will be able to write minimal types of programs and run the code. It is not intended to go into advanced topics like asynchronous programming, frameworks, bundlers, or advanced software engineering principles.

The programs are intended to be run in the terminal as that is common to most operating systems. Linux and Mac come preinstalled with a terminal. Windows may or may not have it pre-installed. "Windows Terminal" can be installed from the Microsoft store. Just do a search for it and install it.
## Installation and Setup of Bun
To set up Bun, navigate to the [Bun](https://bun.sh/) website and follow the installation instructions for your operating system. If the runtime has been installed properly you will be able to type the following command in the terminal command line and receive the response shown:
```
$ bun --version
1.x.x
(Note: the version shown here varies with your installed version)
```
## How to Run Examples

Each lesson folder contains both a `.js` (JavaScript) and a `.ts` (TypeScript) source file, plus a `.md` file showing run commands and expected output.

### JavaScript

No setup required. Navigate into the lesson folder and run with `bun`:

```
$ cd 01_hello-world
$ bun hello-world.js
```

### TypeScript

Bun runs TypeScript natively — no toolchain setup needed. Navigate into the lesson folder and run with `bun`:

```
$ cd 01_hello-world
$ bun hello-world.ts
```

Both produce identical output.
