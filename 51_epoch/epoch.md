#### All values will vary with each run since they reflect the current time. JavaScript represents Unix time in milliseconds (`Date.getTime()`). The nanosecond value is approximated by multiplying milliseconds by 1,000,000 since JavaScript's `Date` only has millisecond precision — unlike Go which has nanosecond precision via `time.UnixNano()`.
